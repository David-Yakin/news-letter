                            <h3>The secret is in the pressing</h3>
                            <p>
                                The quality of an oil is determined by two indices: the pressing process and the acidity level.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>First cold pressing</h3>
                            <p>AvocadoilTM undergoes a brief cold pressed process that does not destroy its nutritional values. This is a purely physical process that combines low temperature pressing with a sealed system that prevents oxidation. The cold pressed process preserves the oil's quality and good taste. The result is a delicate, pure, exceptionally tasty, extra virgin quality oil (i.e. pressed only once).
                            </p>
                            <h3>Low acidity level</h3>
                            <p>An oil's acidity level is determined by the percentage of fatty acids prone to oxidation. The lower the acidity level, the higher the quality of the oil. Lowacid oils are more delicate and do not leave an acrid aftertaste. The acidity level of cold pressed avocadoilTM is 0.2%!

                            <p>An oil's smoke point is the point at which the oil begins to break down and leave a smoky residue in the in the oil and the food in which it is fried, cooked or baked. These smoke particles are detrimental both to the oil's nutritional value and culinary quality.
                                <br> The smoke point of avocadoilTM is 250 degrees Celsius 437 /Fahrenheit) (the highest among all coldpressed vegetable oils). As a result, it is suitable for various cooking techniques such as sautéing, stirfrying and deep-frying.
